      <p>At least once every day in 2017, someone in Chicago was a victim of gun violence. Whether it was because of a gang, domestic abuse, or robbery, Chicago has a higher number of shootings than New York or Los Angeles. 2017 saw a decrease in gun violence from the previous year by 21% according to the Chicago Sun-Times, but that hasn't stopped Chicago becoming one of the deadliest cities in America.<p>

      <h2 class="subhead">The Victims of Chicago's Gun Violence</h2>

      <div id="chart-1" class="shootings_diagram.jpg"></div>

      <p>There were 3,473 shooting victims in Chicago in 2017. 603 of them were killed. The victims ages ranged from four-day-old Jenae Lemon, born prematurely after her mother was shot, to 86-year-old Donald McNamara who was killed by a family member.<p>

      <h2 class="subhead">A shooting every day and twice on Sundays</h2>

      <div id="chart-2" class="chart placeholder"></div>

      <p> Most of the year's shootings happened on Sundays, almost twice as many as Thursdays. However, the total number of shootings during weekdays is 60% higher than shootings on a Saturday or Sunday.   <p>

      <h2 class="subhead">Methodology</h2>
      
      <p> I submitted a FOIA request to the Chicago Police Department in July of 2018 and received two spreadsheets in October. One spreadsheet was all shootings with each row representing a victim; each incident was given a unique records division number. The other spreadsheet was fatal victims only. Armand helped me combine these two spreadsheets and designate the fatal versus non fatal shootings using a true/false formula through Sublime Text. I also gave each listing a latitude and longitude using the census geocoder. I created new columns to identify the day of the week and used pivot tables to analyze for patterns. <p>

      <p> Once I was sure that my data was clean and accurate, I used Adobe Illustrator to make a bar graph for the days of the week. I also used Illustrator to make a diagram representing each victim for both fatal and non-fatal shootings. To create the map, I used QGIS. The shape files for the police districts were provided by the City of Chicago data portal. The exact address was not provided for privacy reasons, however the block was provided. The last two digits for each address block is 15. <p>
